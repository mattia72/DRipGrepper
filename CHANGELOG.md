All relevant changes to the project are documented in this file.

## [v4.10.1-beta] - 2025-08-01

### üêû Fixed
- '=' in search text is not interpreted in command line arguments (#15)
- handling empty collection of saved matches (#16)

### üîÑ Changed
- Refactoring: The GitHub release functions (`New-Release`, `New-ReleaseNotes`, `Add-AssetToRelease`) were extracted from `Deploy-DRipGrepper.ps1` and implemented as reusable functions with explicit parameters in `GitHubReleaseUtils.ps1`.
- The calls in `Deploy-DRipGrepper.ps1` and `gh-release.ps1` were adapted accordingly, so that no global variables are needed anymore.

### üí• Added
- This `CHANGELOG.md` file for better traceability of changes.
- Automatic VSCode detection and configuration for "Open With" functionality

## [4.10.0-beta] - 2025-07-24
